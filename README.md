# Submission
This almost completes up to step 2 in the tech test. Issues arose trying to align the database table migration script (all works) with the task of adding a field to the user - in the system this is added elsewhere. Trying to do it natively within the code using behaviours was a massive headache. I'm sure it's something simple but after a couple of days of time... I tried to extend the User model / element, but unfortunately I'm way out of time.
